Subject: [PATCH] libblkid: make I/O errors on CDROMs non-fatal

It seems too tricky to get a real size of the data track on hybrid
disks with audio+data. It seems overkill to analyze all header in
libblkid and on some disks it's probably possible to get I/O error
almost everywhere due to crazy copy protection etc.
