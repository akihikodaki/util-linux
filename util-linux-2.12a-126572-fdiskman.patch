 There are several *fdisk programs around.
 Each has its problems and strengths.
 Try them in the order
-.BR cfdisk ,
+.BR parted ,
 .BR fdisk ,
 .BR sfdisk .
-(Indeed,
-.B cfdisk
-is a beautiful program that has strict requirements on
-the partition tables it accepts, and produces high quality partition
-tables. Use it if you can.
-.B fdisk
-is a buggy program that does fuzzy things - usually it happens to
-produce reasonable results. Its single advantage is that it has
-some support for BSD disk labels and other non-DOS partition tables.
-Avoid it if you can.
-.B sfdisk
-is for hackers only - the user interface is terrible, but it is
-more correct than fdisk and more powerful than both fdisk and cfdisk.
-Moreover, it can be used noninteractively.)
-.PP
-These days there also is
-.BR parted .
-The cfdisk interface is nicer, but parted does much more: it not only
-resizes partitions, but also the filesystems that live in them.

 The IRIX/SGI type disklabel is currently not supported by the kernel.
 Moreover, IRIX/SGI header directories are not fully supported yet.
