 In particular, it may well fail if the kernel was compiled with devfs
 but devfs is not mounted.
+.PP
+It is possible that files 
+.IR /etc/mtab
+and 
+.IR /proc/mounts
+don't match. The first file is based only on the mount command options, but the
+content of the second file also depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g.
+remote NFS server. In particular case the mount command may reports unreliable
+information about a NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts file usually contains
+more reliable information.)
+.PP
+Checking files on NFS filesystem referenced by file descriptors (i.e. the 
+.BR fcntl 
+and 
+.BR ioctl
+families of functions) may lead to inconsistent result due to the lack of
+consistency check in kernel even if noac is used.
